## View Objects

```python
class View(ScrollableControl, AdaptiveControl)
```

View is the top most container for all other controls.

A root view is automatically created when a new user session started. From layout perspective the View represents a `Column`(https://flet.dev/docs/controls/column/) control, so it has a similar behavior and shares same properties.
