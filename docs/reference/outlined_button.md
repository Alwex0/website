## OutlinedButton Objects

```python
class OutlinedButton(ConstrainedControl, AdaptiveControl)
```

Outlined buttons are medium-emphasis buttons. They contain actions that are important, but arenâ€™t the primary action in an app. Outlined buttons pair well with filled buttons to indicate an alternative, secondary action.

**Example**:

```
import flet as ft

def main(page: ft.Page):
    page.title = "Basic outlined buttons"
    page.add(
        ft.OutlinedButton(text="Outlined button"),
        ft.OutlinedButton("Disabled button", disabled=True),
    )

ft.app(target=main)
```
