## CupertinoSlider Objects

```python
class CupertinoSlider(ConstrainedControl)
```

An iOS-type slider.

It provides a visual indication of adjustable content, as well as the current setting in the total range of content.

Use a slider when you want people to set defined values (such as volume or brightness), or when people would benefit from instant feedback on the effect of setting changes.
